## Glossary

### Auto Scrape Runs
- **What:** Scheduled executions defined in `scrapers/auto_scrape.py` that loop through the YAML competitor list.
- **Why:** Ensures fresh data without manual intervention; the summary output flags failures early.
- **How:** `python scrapers/auto_scrape.py --run-now` for a manual trigger; check the console/log summary for ads scraped and output paths.
- **Related Entries:** `First Scrape`, `Pipeline Health Check`

### Campaign Insights
- **What:** Aggregated stats generated by `CampaignAggregator` (offer share, category dominance, top keywords).
- **Why:** Turns raw ad analysis into actionable talking points for marketing and strategy reviews.
- **How:** Inspect the text report and JSON in `data/output/` after running `run_analysis.py`; highlight the one-line summary when briefing stakeholders.
- **Related Entries:** `Hybrid Analyzer`, `Weekly Insights`

### First Scrape
- **What:** The starting workflow that grabs creatives for a competitor and prepares them for analysis.
- **Why:** Produces the CSV input required by all downstream enrichment tools.
- **How:** `python scrapers/extension_scraper.py --url <GATC_URL> --name <Competitor> --max-ads 400 --chrome-profile <ProfilePath> --download-dir data/input`; confirm the CSV lands in `data/input/`.
- **Related Entries:** `Auto Scrape Runs`, `Hybrid Analyzer`

### Hybrid Analyzer
- **What:** The two-stage analysis (`llava` vision + `deepseek-r1` text) implemented in `analyzers/hybrid.py`.
- **Why:** Balances accuracy and speed, making it the default option for day-to-day workflows.
- **How:** `python run_analysis.py --input <CSV_PATH> --analyzer hybrid`; review the console preview and the exported JSON for sanity.
- **Related Entries:** `Campaign Insights`, `Weekly Insights`

### Pipeline Health Check
- **What:** Manual verification steps that confirm the scrape→analyze→report loop is healthy.
- **Why:** Catches bad credentials, stale cookies, or model outages before stakeholders see gaps.
- **How:** Run `python easy_run.py`, complete a full workflow, then inspect the generated CSV/JSON and text report; repeat after any config or dependency change.
- **Related Entries:** `Auto Scrape Runs`, `API Smoke Test`

### Weekly Insights
- **What:** Higher-level narrative summaries produced by `api/insights_engine.py` combining vision analysis and text generation.
- **Why:** Provides concise talking points for weekly competitive review decks.
- **How:** Trigger via the API (`POST /api/insights/weekly`) or run the engine directly with curated CSVs; share the top three insights with the team.
- **Related Entries:** `Campaign Insights`, `Hybrid Analyzer`

### API Smoke Test
- **What:** Quick check that the FastAPI service and background jobs respond correctly.
- **Why:** Prevents surprises before handing the API to dashboards or partners.
- **How:** `python api/test_client.py`, choose option 1 (scrape) or 2 (analyze), and wait for the success summary; failures indicate network, model, or path issues.
- **Related Entries:** `Pipeline Health Check`, `Auto Scrape Runs`

## Maintaining This Guide
- Revisit entries whenever `DOCUMENTATION.md` introduces a new module or workflow.
- Add new glossary terms for emerging features (e.g., additional analyzers or storage backends).
- Flag deprecated entries with a note and link to the replacement workflow so the glossary stays trustworthy.
