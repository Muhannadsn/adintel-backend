# Security Review Handover Package

## 📦 What's Included

This package contains all files necessary for cybersecurity and engineering teams to review the Ad Intelligence platform's legal compliance measures.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start for Reviewers

### **1. Read the Security Review Document**
```bash
open SECURITY_REVIEW.md
```
This document explains:
- Why we need a proxy (Qatar law)
- How the proxy works
- What files to review
- Testing procedures

### **2. Review These Critical Files**

**Primary Files** (MUST REVIEW):
- `scrapers/api_scraper.py` - Main scraping logic with proxy
- `test_proxy.py` - Proxy connectivity test
- `test_scraper_with_proxy.py` - End-to-end scraping test
- `SECURITY_REVIEW.md` - Complete security documentation

**Secondary Files** (SHOULD REVIEW):
- `scheduled_scraper.py` - Automated daily scraping
- `api/main.py` - Backend API endpoints
- `railway.toml` - Deployment configuration
- `Dockerfile` - Container configuration

### **3. Run Security Tests**

**Test 1: Proxy Connection**
```bash
cd /path/to/ad-intelligence
python3 test_proxy.py
```
**Expected**: ✅ All tests pass, IP shows as non-Qatar

**Test 2: Scraping Through Proxy**
```bash
python3 test_scraper_with_proxy.py
```
**Expected**: ✅ Successfully fetches ads through proxy

**Test 3: Network Traffic Monitoring** (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
# On macOS:
sudo tcpdump -i en0 host adstransparency.google.com

# Then run the scraper and verify NO TRAFFIC shows up
# All traffic should go to brd.superproxy.io only
```

## 🚨 Red Flags to Watch For

### **During Code Review**:
❌ Any `use_proxy=False` in production code
❌ Direct connections to `adstransparency.google.com`
❌ Hardcoded credentials in committed files
❌ No error handling for proxy failures
❌ Fallback to direct connection if proxy fails

### **During Testing**:
❌ Tests show Qatar IP address
❌ Network traffic shows direct GATC connections
❌ Proxy tests fail or timeout
❌ Errors about "Connection refused" or "Proxy error"
